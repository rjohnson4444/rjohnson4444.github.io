        <p>Hi!</p>
        <p>
          My name is Ryan Johnson and I am currently a student at Turing
          School of Software and Design. Before Turing, I was a health and fitness
          professional that focused on sports perfomance and rehabilitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Born and raised in Colorado, but you will NOT find me on any ski slopes
          (I've seen way to many injuries in the PT clinic. I like my knees!).
        </p>
